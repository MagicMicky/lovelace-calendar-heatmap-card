> ‚ö†Ô∏è **AI-Assisted Development Warning**: This project has been largely developed with the assistance of AI tools (Claude and Cursor). I only have a basic understanding of what this code does and have been using this project as a way to experiment with AI-assisted development while creating a component I wanted for my dashboard. The code may contain inconsistencies, and best practices might only be partially followed due to the contextual limitations of AI. Use at your own risk and feel free to contribute improvements!

A custom Lovelace card for Home Assistant that visualizes entity activity data as a calendar heatmap, similar to GitHub's contribution graph. Perfect for tracking game activity, device usage, or any time-based data.

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Make sure [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed in your Home Assistant instance
2. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS:
   - Go to HACS ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí ‚ãÆ ‚Üí Custom repositories
   - Add `https://github.com/MagicMicky/lovelace-calendar-heatmap-card` as a "Lovelace" repository
3. Search for "Calendar Heatmap Card" in the Frontend section and install it
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the `calendar-heatmap-card.js` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/MagicMicky/lovelace-calendar-heatmap-card/releases)
2. Upload it to your Home Assistant instance using the following path:
   ```
   /config/www/community/lovelace-calendar-heatmap-card/calendar-heatmap-card.js
   ```
3. Add the resource reference to your Lovelace configuration:
   ```yaml
   resources:
     - url: /local/community/lovelace-calendar-heatmap-card/calendar-heatmap-card.js
       type: module
   ```
4. Restart Home Assistant

## Usage

Add the card to your Lovelace dashboard:

```yaml
type: custom:calendar-heatmap-card
entity: sensor.game_activity
title: My Gaming Activity
days_to_show: 365
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `entity` | string | (Required) | Entity ID to display history for |
| `title` | string | "Game Activity" | Card title |
| `days_to_show` | number | 365 | Number of days of history to display (Note: In v3.3.0+, the actual display is automatically adjusted based on available space) |
| `ignored_states` | array | ["unknown", "idle", "offline", ""] | States to ignore in calculations |
| `refresh_interval` | number | 300 | Refresh interval in seconds |
| `start_day_of_week` | string | "monday" | Day to start the week on ("monday" or "sunday") |
| `include_unknown` | boolean | false | Whether to include "unknown" state in calculations |

### Example Configurations

#### Basic Configuration
```yaml
type: custom:calendar-heatmap-card
entity: sensor.steam_activity
title: Steam Gaming Activity
```

#### Advanced Configuration
```yaml
type: custom:calendar-heatmap-card
entity: sensor.steam_activity
title: Steam Gaming Activity
days_to_show: 180
ignored_states:
  - idle
  - offline
  - ""
refresh_interval: 600
start_day_of_week: sunday
include_unknown: true
```

## New in Version 3.3.0

### Automatic Sizing

The card now automatically adjusts the number of weeks displayed based on the available space in your dashboard. This ensures optimal visibility regardless of your screen size or dashboard layout. The heatmap will show between 4 and 52 weeks, depending on the available width.

### Limited Card Height

The card now has a fixed height to ensure consistent appearance across dashboards. This prevents the card from becoming too tall when there's a lot of data.

### Game Display Limit

The detail view now shows a limited number of games by default (4), with a "Show all" button to reveal the complete list. This improves readability and performance, especially for users with many different games or states.

## Theming

The Calendar Heatmap Card features advanced theme-aware color handling that automatically adapts to your Home Assistant theme. The card will detect whether you're using a light or dark theme and adjust colors accordingly for optimal visibility.

### Custom Theme Variables

You can customize the appearance of the heatmap by adding these variables to your Home Assistant theme:

```yaml
calendar-heatmap-no-data-color: "#ebedf0"  # Color for days with no data
calendar-heatmap-level-1: "#c6e48b"        # Color for lowest activity level
calendar-heatmap-level-2: "#7bc96f"        # Color for low-medium activity level
calendar-heatmap-level-3: "#239a3b"        # Color for medium-high activity level
calendar-heatmap-level-4: "#196127"        # Color for highest activity level
```

If these variables are not defined, the card will fall back to using Home Assistant's standard theme colors:

- `--disabled-text-color` for no data
- `--success-color` for level 1
- `--primary-color` for level 2
- `--accent-color` for level 3
- `--state-active-color` for level 4

### Theme Detection

In version 3.3.0, the theme detection has been improved to:

1. Automatically detect theme changes in real-time
2. Properly detect themes from parent elements (useful for cards inside dashboards with different themes)
3. Adapt colors for better contrast in both light and dark themes

### Visual Differentiation

The card uses an improved intensity scaling algorithm that provides better visual differentiation between different activity durations:

- Very short sessions (< 15 min)
- Short sessions (15-45 min)
- Medium sessions (45 min - 2 hours)
- Longer sessions (2-4 hours)
- High usage sessions (4-8 hours)
- Very high usage sessions (8+ hours)

This makes it easier to distinguish between days with different levels of activity at a glance.

## Entity Requirements

This card works best with entities that:

1. Have different states representing different activities (like game names)
2. Change state frequently enough to generate meaningful data
3. Maintain history in Home Assistant

Examples include:
- Game activity sensors (Steam, PlayStation, etc.)
- Device usage sensors
- Presence/occupancy sensors
- Any sensor that changes state throughout the day

## Integration Examples

### Discord Game Activity

The Calendar Heatmap Card works perfectly with the [Discord Game integration](https://github.com/LordBoos/discord_game) for Home Assistant, which provides a sensor that tracks the games you play.

When you set up the Discord Game integration, it creates a sensor for each user that shows the current game being played. The sensor follows the format `sensor.discord_user_*_game` where `*` is your Discord user ID. This sensor's state changes to the name of the game when you're playing something, and to "idle", "offline", or other status indicators when you're not.

#### Example Configuration

```yaml
type: custom:calendar-heatmap-card
entity: sensor.discord_user_game
title: My Discord Gaming Activity
days_to_show: 365
ignored_states:
  - unknown
  - idle
  - offline
  - ""
  - dnd
  - online
refresh_interval: 300
start_day_of_week: monday
```

Replace `sensor.discord_user_game` with your actual Discord game sensor as it appears in Home Assistant.

#### How It Works

The Calendar Heatmap Card will:
- Track the time spent in each game state
- Display different colors for different games
- Show a breakdown of your gaming activity when you hover over or click on a day
- Filter out states like "idle" and "offline" by default (configurable)

This gives you a beautiful visualization of your gaming habits over time, showing which days you played the most and which games dominated your play time.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Data Showing
- Ensure your entity has historical data in Home Assistant
- Check that the entity states aren't all in the `ignored_states` list
- Verify that `days_to_show` isn't set too low

#### Colors Not Matching Theme
- Make sure you're using a recent version of Home Assistant
- Try adding the custom theme variables mentioned in the Theming section
- Check if your theme properly defines the fallback variables

#### Performance Issues
- Try reducing `days_to_show` to display fewer days
- Increase `refresh_interval` to reduce update frequency

#### Card Size Issues
- In version 3.3.0+, the card automatically adjusts to available space
- If the card appears too small, try placing it in a wider column in your dashboard
- The card height is now fixed for better UI integration
